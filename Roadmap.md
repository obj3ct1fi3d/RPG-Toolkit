# Development Roadmap for World Maker and World Travel

## Phase 1: Core Features Development

### **Task 1: World Maker Basic Functionality**

1. **Map Editor:**

    - Implement a grid-based map editor with support for customizable grid sizes.
    - Add tile placement functionality for basic terrain types (e.g., grass, water, dirt).
    - Include a simple tile-selection UI.

2. **Object Placement:**

    - Enable placement of objects like NPCs, chests, and other interactable items.
    - Create a basic interface for configuring object properties (e.g., NPC names, object descriptions).

3. **Export and Save:**
    - Add functionality to export maps to JSON format.
    - Implement a local storage feature for saving and loading maps.

### **Task 2: World Travel Basic Functionality**

1. **Map Loading:**

    - Develop a feature to load JSON maps created in World Maker.
    - Render loaded maps accurately within the p5.js canvas.

2. **Player Movement:**

    - Implement grid-based movement for the player characters using mouse or touch controls.
    - Add collision detection for impassable tiles (e.g., water or mountains).

3. **Interactions:**
    - Create a basic interaction system for NPC dialogues and item collection.

## Phase 2: Advanced Features Development

### **Task 1: Enhanced World Maker Features**

1. **Complex Terrain Types:**

    - Expand tile options to include forest, mountain, and other detailed terrains.
    - Add custom terrain management tools to allow user-defined tile creation.

2. **Region Tagging:**

    - Implement a tagging system for defining map regions (e.g., "town," "dungeon").
    - Include a visualization tool for managing and editing tagged areas.

3. **Map Layers:**
    - Add support for multiple map layers (e.g., terrain, objects, and events).
    - Create toggles to easily switch between layers during editing.

### **Task 2: Advanced World Travel Features**

1. **Event System:**

    - Introduce an event system to trigger predefined actions, such as opening doors or starting quests.

2. **Quest Log:**

    - Implement a quest tracking system displaying active and completed quests.

3. **Dynamic UI Elements:**
    - Develop a dynamic HUD to display player stats, inventory, and quest progress.

## Phase 3: Gameplay Mechanics

### **Task 1: Combat System**

1. **Turn-Based Combat:**

    - Add a turn-based combat feature, allowing players to engage NPCs or enemies.
    - Include basic attack, health, and damage mechanics.

2. **Skill System:**
    - Develop a skill system for player abilities (e.g., healing, special attacks).

### **Task 2: Inventory Management**

1. **Inventory UI:**

    - Create an interface to display collected items and manage their usage.

2. **Item Effects:**
    - Add functionality for items to affect player stats (e.g., potions restoring health).

## Phase 4: World Expansion Tools

### **Task 1: Procedural Generation**

1. **Random Terrain Generator:**

    - Implement algorithms for generating random terrains and regions.
    - Include parameters for customization (e.g., biome types, map size).

2. **Dungeon Generator:**
    - Add tools for creating procedurally generated dungeons with predefined rules.

### **Task 2: Multiplayer Support (Optional)**

1. **Shared World Exploration:**
    - Develop a feature to allow multiple players to explore the same world simultaneously.
    - Use WebSockets or similar technologies for real-time updates.
