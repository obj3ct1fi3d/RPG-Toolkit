# World Maker and World Travel

## Overview

**World Maker** and **World Travel** are browser-based tools developed using JavaScript and p5.js. These tools allow users to create and explore custom tabletop RPG maps and scenarios directly in their browser.

-   **World Maker**: A grid-based map editor for creating worlds.
-   **World Travel**: A map exploration tool for interacting with created worlds.

## Features

-   Basic object placement (NPCs, items).
-   Save and export maps in JSON format.

### World Travel

-   Load and explore maps created in World Maker.
-   Player movement and interactions.
-   Basic UI for inventory and player stats.

## Technologies Used

-   **JavaScript**: Core programming language.
-   **p5.js**: For rendering and handling canvas-based interactions.
-   **HTML/CSS**: For the user interface and layout.
